What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
  With JRuby, you can interact with Java's Atomic objects from java.util.concurrent.atomic,
  but is there anything equivalent on MRI/Rubinius that allows for lock-free thread-safe
  variables?
  I'm also curious to learn more about best practices for inter-thread communication.

What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
  I'd like to see a thread pool built in the standard library.
