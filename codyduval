What would you like to learn about concurrency?
- What does concurrency look like in Ruby compared to some other languages?
- How does this change in Ruby 2.0?

What do you wish Ruby did better for concurrency?
- I don't have a wish yet, as concurrency (or Ruby's lack there-of) is not yet a pain-point for me.
