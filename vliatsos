# What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
I'd like to learn about the current state of Ruby's concurrency features that take advantage of multi-threaded and multicore processors.

# What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
I wish that ruby had similar features to Java for concurrency. 
I ended up using jruby for that reason.
